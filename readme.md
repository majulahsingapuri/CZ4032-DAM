Ruleitems
{
class_label 
condset : dictionary of key value pairs
Out of less than(__lt__), greater than(__gt__), less than equal to(__le__) and greater than equal to(__ge__), atleast one should be defined in the class being decorated using this method.
}
Ruleitem a, Ruleitem b 
we should be able to use a<b 
so that can use (sorted(cars))



the last element in case d is the class label 

dataset is a list of list  [[1, 1, 1], [1, 1, 1], [1, 2, 1], [2, 2, 1], [2, 2, 1]]

class label in the dataset.
seach rule has a classCasesCovered dictionary
rule has replace datafield that contains <cRule,dID,y>
w.replace = w.replace È {<cRule, dID, y>};
